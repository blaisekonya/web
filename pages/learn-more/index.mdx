# Welcome to the World Association

The World Association is a democratic United Nations alternative with an own digital currency. It was born out of the realization that without proactive and inclusive governance, AI could catalyze global totalitarianism, exacerbate winner-take-all markets, and even lead to human extinction. By giving people a voice in global decisions, we aim to maintain global peace and security and create a future where no one is left behind.

</Steps>

## Core features

### Proposal creation and democratic voting

We are operating a completely anonymous yet verifiably democratic voting system. Our voting tokens, called global democracy tokens (GDTs), are automatically issued to members upon joining. Members can submit proposals and participate in democratic decision-making using our [Snapshot space](https://snapshot.org/#/worldassociation.eth) (and even use GDTs at their own space), where all proposals and votes are [transparently recorded](https://docs.ipfs.tech/case-studies/snapshot/#what-is-snapshot).

#### About global democracy tokens

Global democracy tokens are non-transferable ERC20s created using an audited thirdweb smart contract (see a test version [here](https://base.blockscout.com/token/0x2F9e9e5D597f245df027F5a900f6E0957472A564)). The tokens are distributed to members who verify their identity with [zkMe](https://zk.me/did-solution).

<Callout type="info">
  We will soon introduce additional GDTs, minted after
  [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/onchain-verify) and [World
  ID](https://worldcoin.org/world-id) verifications, to increase the robustness
  of our system.

### Global basic income

As soon as they join, members begin to receive a basic income in our official currency, the world drachma. By providing a basic income, we aim to reduce economic inequality, promote global financial inclusion, and empower individuals to actively participate in the global economy.

#### Distribution method

Our basic income is distributed by-the-second using [Superfluid](https://www.superfluid.finance), a revolutionary asset streaming protocol. This ensures seamless, continuous financial support, allowing members to access their income without delays. You can view a test stream [here](https://app.superfluid.finance/stream/base/0xa3c2c8ce6be1c55401b5f1efb6112a86f6374429-0x30deD934aac8bb469997AeC40854E38ecd9dC99A-0x524986180284488c8c337d7089f58e0649559cda-0.0?view=0x30deD934aac8bb469997AeC40854E38ecd9dC99A).

#### About the world drachma

The world drachma is a [burnable and mintable Pure Super Token](https://docs.superfluid.finance/docs/protocol/super-tokens/overview#types-of-super-tokens) that inherits all Superfluid functionalities and can also be regulated to meet the economic needs of our global community.
