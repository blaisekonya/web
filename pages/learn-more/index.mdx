# Welcome to the World Association Documentation

## Overview

The World Association is a pioneering organization dedicated to democratizing global governance. Our mission is to empower individuals worldwide by enabling anonymous participation in decision-making processes, addressing humanity’s most urgent challenges collectively. Our platform is accessible and free to use, providing members with a basic income and a voice in global decisions through a transparent and secure voting system.

### Why is this important?

As advanced AI and other technologies evolve, there is a risk of increasing global inequality, undemocratic practices, and even authoritarian control. Without proactive and inclusive governance, AI could catalyze global totalitarianism, exacerbate winner-take-all markets, and displace labor, leading to a permanent lock-in of harmful values and amplified risks of extinction due to reduced governmental competence. The World Association aims to counter these risks by promoting global cooperation, democratic decision-making, and equitable resource distribution.

## Core features

### Proposals and democratic voting

Voting tokens (Global Democracy Tokens) are minted and distributed to members automatically upon joining. We guarantee the one-person-one-vote principle through our robust verification process, ensuring that each member has an equal voice.

#### About the Global Democracy Token

Our Global Democracy Token is a non-transferable ("soulbound") ERC20 based on an audited thirdweb contract (test version can be viewed [here](https://base.blockscout.com/token/0x2F9e9e5D597f245df027F5a900f6E0957472A564)). This token is distributed to members who verify their identity with [zkMe's MeID](https://zk.me/did-solution).

We will introduce additional GDTs issued after [World ID](https://worldcoin.org/world-id) and [Coinbase verifications](https://www.coinbase.com/onchain-verify) to increase the robustness of the system, thereby increasing flexibility and security.

#### Using the Global Democracy Token

- **Create proposals**: Submit proposals using [our space on Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/worldassociation.eth), a free platform for decentralized voting.
- **Vote with Snapshot**: Participate in the decision-making process by voting on proposals.

All proposals and votes are recorded, ensuring transparency and trust.

### Global basic income

By providing a basic income, we aim to reduce economic inequality, promote global financial inclusion, and empower individuals to actively participate in the global economy. Our digital currency, the world drachma, is used to distribute the global basic income. You can view the test version [here](https://base.blockscout.com/token/0x524986180284488c8c337d7089F58E0649559cDa?tab=contract).

**Claiming your basic income**: Once verified, you will automatically receive a regular basic income in our official currency.

**Superfluid streams**: Our basic income is distributed by-the-second using [Superfluid](https://www.superfluid.finance), a cutting-edge protocol that enables real-time financial transactions. This ensures seamless, instant financial support, allowing members to access their income continuously without delays or the need for manual transactions.
